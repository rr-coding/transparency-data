Personal Transparency: Working Hours – Sep 19 to Jan 20

About the data:

This is the first new data-publish in my personal transparency experiment.
This data covers my time in work or work-related activities from 23 Sep 19 to 10 Jan 20.
This work is logged against four categories:
Working in Office (self-explanatory)
Working from home or remote location (e.g. train, cafe, home)
Self-directed learning (coding, other learning and time spent writing this blog)
Formal learning (Civil Service learning or other organised courses)
Data published: Date, timestamp, Start/Begin, End/Leave, Category
Format: .csv
I have corrected the data, mainly to cover for those entries where I logged after the fact (so the ‘timestamp’ on the log is not the actual time that was logged). Plus also a few errors and omissions.
Work Log – Corrected Data – Sep19-Jan20Download

How I gathered the data:

I used a simple Google Form, via a shortcut on my phone’s home screen. The form allows immediate logging of the ‘start’ or ‘end’ of an activity, and the category of activity.
The form also allows me to note down an alternative time if I am logging after the event rather than at the time the acivity occured. I needed to do this a lot as I very often forgot to log at the time. In general when I logged after the fact I approximated to the nearest 5 mins.
Note that I have not logged any ‘travelling time’ (either routine commuting to work, or longer journeys to meetings at other offices). The only exceptions to this are where I have worked on the train, which I have logged as ‘Working from home or remote location’

Learning, insight and follow-up from this exercise:

With a simple form in place, it is not a significant effort for me to record this data.
It’s vital to log the work as it happens – logging the times after the fact and then correcting the data later is confusing and time-consuming!
I will perform some analysis on this data when I have got better at recording it – and have more of it.
